# CoCivium Ethics Request (Voluntary)
This tool is **free and open**. We ask — not require — that users align with transparent, non-coercive, non-corrupt norms:
- No crowns (no unaccountable power); no coercion; no corruption.
- Keep provenance and audit trails when redistributing.
- If you improve it, consider contributing back.

This request does **not** modify the license. See LICENSE for terms.
